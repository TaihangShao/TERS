### Function for Generalized Additive Model

A generalized additive model may be viewed as a generalized additive model in which a covariate x is replaced by a linear combination of a finite set of smooth functions *b1, . . . , bq.* GAM models can be defined as follow:

$$
E(y_t)=\sum^q_{j=i}b_j(t)\beta_j=f(t)
$$

Where *b~j~(t)* refers to the jth basis function, *q* refers to the dimension of the basis function. Usually, RCS can be used as a basis function. In this APP, RCS is set as the basis function.
