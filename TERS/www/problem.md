### Help when the APP crashes

If you encounter a program crash, here are some solutions:

(1) Check whether you have inputted the data. **Any further without inputting the data will lead to crash.** Similarly, not inputting background mortality data when running a cure model can also lead to crashes.

(2) Check the GenF in Standard survival model. You can check not to run the GenF model.

(3) Check your data. If you input too little data (your survival data is too immature), some flexible models can not generate any results. **Therefore, if you keep on drawing the plot, the APP will crash.** In this case, we recommend you to use simple models or use more mature data.

(4) There are some bugs in this APP. We will be great appreciated if you can report these bugs to us so that we can improve this APP. The contact information can be found in the homepage.
