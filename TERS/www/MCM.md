### Function for Mixture Cure Model

The commonly used theoretical work behind mixture cure modelling uses a relative survival situation where it is likely that events---be it death or progression---for cured and uncured patients will occur within similar time frames. In the relative survival setting, the mixture cure model can be shown as follows:

$$
S(t)=S^*(t)[ùûπ+(1-ùûπ)S_U(t)]
$$

*S(t)* refers to the population survival function; *S\*(t)* refers to baseline survival function to capture the survival rate of general population of interest (background survival rate); œÄ refers to cure fraction; *S~U~(t)* refers to the¬†survival function of the uncured fraction.

All-cause survival is usually introduced as background mortality, that is, *S\*(t)*. In this APP, life table of the USA is set as the example background mortality. It can be obtained from WHO on ([https://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.main.61780?lang=en).](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.main.61780?lang=en).)
