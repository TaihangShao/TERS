### Warning in Parametric mixture models

In some situations, there may occur errors when running Parametric mixture models (Some combinations of distributions). To be specific: "Optimisation has probably not converged to the maximum likelihood - Hessian is not positive definite". Warnings are not shown in this APP. Please be attention to these results. But generally speaking, these warnings do not have much impact on the final conclusion.
