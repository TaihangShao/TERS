### Choose the Order of FP

To choose the order of FP, the following closed test procedure may be used:

-   Overall association of results with time, comparing FP(2) model with model omitting time. If the result shows no significance, time is no need to be included in the model.

-   Evidence for non-linearity, comparing FP(2) model with a model that is linear in time. If the result shows no significance, power = 1 is enough.

-   Simpler or more complex non-linear model, comparing FP(2) model with FP(1) model. If the result shows no significance, FP(1) model is preferred.
