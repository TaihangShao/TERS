Data input here is the **Individual Patient Data (IPD)**. IPD can be reconstructed based on the *Guyot.et.al's* method or some other methods if you only have the published KM curves. This process will not be described in detail here.

We highly recommend you to load the example data or download the *xlsx.* file to see the format of the input data. Input with wrong format may lead to the collapse of this APP.
